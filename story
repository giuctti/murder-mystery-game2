Last night, at 7:50 PM, Mr. Blackwell was found dead in the study room of his big house. The police arrived quickly and started to ask questions. Seven people were in the house at the time of the murder. Each person knew Mr. Blackwell well, and each person had a reason to be angry with him.

David, the gardener, worked for Mr. Blackwell for many years. He liked the garden and cared for the plants every day. Last week, Mr. Blackwell decided to cut many trees without asking David. David felt sad and disrespected.

Frank, the musician, often played the piano for Mr. Blackwell’s guests. He loved music, but Mr. Blackwell didn’t pay him very well. Frank wanted to leave the job, but Mr. Blackwell refused.

Cynthia, the cook, prepared meals for the house. She cooked delicious food every day. But last month, Mr. Blackwell blamed her for a dinner that the guests didn’t like. He shouted at her in front of everyone. Cynthia felt embarrassed and upset.

Rebecca, the teacher, was Mr. Blackwell’s private tutor for his children many years ago. She lived in a small room in the house. Recently, Mr. Blackwell told her that he planned to send her away because he didn’t need her help anymore. 

Eva, the family doctor, visited the house often because Mr. Blackwell had health problems. Last month, Mr. Blackwell refused to follow her medical advice and blamed her for his pain. Eva felt tired and frustrated.

Susan, the librarian, organized Mr. Blackwell’s private library. She loved books and worked quietly. But Mr. Blackwell wanted to sell some of the rare books, and Susan disagreed, which made her feel angry. 

Every person seemed calm, but also nervous. Everyone had a reason to hate Mr. Blackwell. Now, the police must discover who told the truth… and who lied. The mystery begins.
